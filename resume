        Carols For Cans is a youth-led philanthropic initiative established in 2012. Every December,
        schools around the Greater Toronto Area organize their own caroling event where groups of
        students go caroling door-to-door in exchange for non-perishable food donations, such as
        canned food. Through the Carols For Cans Glenforest 2019 event, over 100 food items were
        collected and donated to the Mississauga Food Bank.
